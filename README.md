# VOC-driven-Plant-Phenotyping
Analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions from tomato plants of different genetic lines subjected to various treatments. The study aims to observe plant responses to the treatments, monitor VOCs variations and contextualize the phenomenon within the framework of plant-plant interactions.

##**ABSTRACT**
This study aims to analyze the **emissions of *VOCs***  (volatile organic compounds) from **tomato plants** of **different genetic** lines subjected to **distinct treatments**.  

The work specifically focused on analyzing **raw data** obtained from Proton Transfer Reaction-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (**PTR-ToF-MS**). The VOC data were stored in **HDF5** (.h5) format, containing **mass spectrometry** measurements that provide insights into the temporal dynamics of volatile emissions.

Each HDF5 file was related to a singular plant and the surveys occurred at **three different times**: September 2023 (**T1**), October 2023 (**T2**), and November 2023 (**T3**).

Using *Principal Component Analysis (**PCA**)* allowed us to **reduce the dimensionality** of the problem, and through ***Feature Importance*** we were able to shift the focus to **key variables** in describing the phenomena.

The process is aimed at observing the **responses** of different plants to **various treatments**, track **VOCs variations** and frame the phenomenon in the broader context of **plant-plant interaction**.
