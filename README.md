# ***VOC-DRIVEN PLANT PHENOTYPING: PATTERNS AND INSIGHTS VIA PCA E FEATURE ANALYSIS***

## **ABSTRACT**
This study aims to analyze the **emissions of *VOCs***  (volatile organic compounds) from **tomato plants** of **different genetic** lines subjected to **distinct treatments**.  

The work specifically focused on analyzing **raw data** obtained from Proton Transfer Reaction-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (**PTR-ToF-MS**). The VOC data were stored in **HDF5** (.h5) format, containing **mass spectrometry** measurements that provide insights into the temporal dynamics of volatile emissions.

Each HDF5 file was related to a singular plant and the surveys occurred at **three different times**: September 2023 (**T1**), October 2023 (**T2**), and November 2023 (**T3**).

Using *Principal Component Analysis (**PCA**)* allowed us to **reduce the dimensionality** of the problem, and through ***Feature Importance*** we were able to shift the focus to **key variables** in describing the phenomena.

The process is aimed at observing the **responses** of different plants to **various treatments**, track **VOCs variations** and frame the phenomenon in the broader context of **plant-plant interaction**.
